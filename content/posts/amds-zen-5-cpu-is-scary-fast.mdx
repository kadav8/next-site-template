AMD's upcoming Zen 5 CPU is going to be a beast. So says the CEO of AI chip startup Tenstorrent, who showed off comparative performance numbers for most of the major CPU architectures yesterday including AMD's yet-to-be-released Zen 5 chip. 

But here's the thing. The CEO of Tenstorrent is none other than Jim Keller, formerly of AMD and the man that headed up the development of Zen itself. Short of official numbers from AMD, in other words, this is about a good as third-party data gets. It's not your usual dodgy YouTube channel 'leak'.

Keller was doing the keynote for a Tenstorrent talk (opens in new tab) for university students in India covering the company's latest RISC-V chips for AI models and the future of computing. Remarkably, Keller pulled up a slide with detailed performance numbers for a range of data center CPUs, including all existing generations of Zen, Intel's latest Sapphire Rapids chip, Amazon's in-house CPUs, Nvidia upcoming Grace chip and... Zen 5.
